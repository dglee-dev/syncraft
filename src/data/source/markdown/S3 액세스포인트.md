## Managing data access with Amazon S3 access points

Amazon S3 access points simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores data in S3.

Access points are 'named network endpoints' that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`.

Each access point has distinct permissions and network controls that S3 applies for any request that is made through that access point.

Each access point enforces a customized access point policy that works in conjunction with the bucket policy that is attached to the underlying bucket. (적용된 bucket의 bucket policy와 결합되어 작용한다)

You can configure any access point to accept requests only from a virtual private cloud(VPC) to restrict Amazon S3 data access to a private network.

You can also configure custom block public access settings for each access point.

*Note

- You can only use access points to perform operations on 'objects'. You can't use access points to perform other Amazon S3 operations, such as modifying or deleting 'buckets'.

- Access points work with some, but not all, AWS services and features.
